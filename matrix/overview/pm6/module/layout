We can show this by separately considering two cases for the n × k matrix A
and the k × m matrix B. In one case, we assume k is at least as large as n
and n ≤ m, and in the other case we assume k < n ≤ m. In both cases, we
represent the rows of AB as k linear combinations of the rows of B.
From equation (3.96), we see that the rank of an outer product matrix
(that is, a matrix formed as the outer product of two vectors) is 1.
Equation (3.96) provides a useful upper bound on rank(AB). In Sec-
tion 3.3.8, we will develop a lower bound on rank(AB).
