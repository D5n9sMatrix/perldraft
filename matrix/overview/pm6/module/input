  This is called a full rank partitioning of B.
  The matrix B in equation (3.99) has a very special property: the full set
  of linearly independent rows are the ﬁrst r rows, and the full set of linearly
  independent columns are the ﬁrst r columns.

=head2 Name
  Any rank r matrix can be put in the form of equation (3.99) by using
  permutation matrices as in equation (3.45), assuming that r ≥ 1. That is, if
  A is a nonzero matrix, there is a matrix of the form of B above that has the
  same rank. For some permutation matrices E π 1 and E π 2 ,
  B = E π 1 AE π 2 .

=head3 Synopsis
 where S is of rank q.
 It is obvious that the rank of a matrix can never exceed its smaller dimen-
 sion (see the discussion of linear independence on page 10). Whether or not
 a matrix has more rows than columns, the rank of the matrix is the same as
 the dimension of the column space of the matrix. (As we have just seen, the
 dimension of the column space is necessarily the same as the dimension of the
 row space, but the order of the column space is diﬀerent from the order of the
 row space unless the matrix is square.)

 3.3.3 Full Rank Matrices and Matrix Inverses
 We have already seen that full rank matrices have some important properties.
 In this section, we consider full rank matrices and matrices that are their
 Cayley multiplicative inverses.

 In this system, A is called the coeﬃcient matrix. An x that satisﬁes this
 system of equations is called a solution to the system. For given A and b, a
 solution may or may not exist. From equation (3.59), a solution exists if and
 only if the n-vector b is in the k-dimensional column space of A, where k ≤ m.
 A system for which a solution exists is said to be consistent; otherwise, it is
 inconsistent.

 Consistent Systems
 A linear system A n×m x = b is consistent if and only if
 rank([A | b]) = rank(A).
 (3.105)
 We can see this by recognizing that the space spanned by the columns of A
 is the same as that spanned by the columns of A and the vector b; therefore
 b must be a linear combination of the columns of A. Furthermore, the linear
 combination is the solution to the system Ax = b. (Note, of course, that it is
 not necessary that it be a unique linear combination.)
 Equation (3.105) is equivalent to the condition
 [A | b]y = 0 ⇔ Ay = 0.
