=head1 Documentation
 The inverses of these permutations coupled with the full rank partitioning of
 B form a full rank partitioning of the original matrix A.
 For a square matrix of rank r, this kind of partitioning implies that there
 is a full rank r × r principal submatrix, and the principal submatrix formed
 by including any of the remaining diagonal elements is singular. The princi-
 pal minor formed from the full rank principal submatrix is nonzero, but if
 the order of the matrix is greater than r, a principal minor formed from a
 submatrix larger than r × r is zero.
