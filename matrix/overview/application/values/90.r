# This comes from a factorization of the binomial 1 − a k , similar to equa-
# tion (3.41), and the fact that a k → 0 if |a| < 1. In Section 3.9 on page 128, we
# will discuss conditions that ensure the convergence of A k for a square matrix
# A. We will deﬁne a norm A on A and show that if A < 1, then A k → 0.
# Then, analogous to the scalar series, using equation (3.41) for a square matrix
# A, we have
k <- 0

# We include this equation here because of its relation to equations (3.133)
# through (3.139). We will discuss it further on page 134, after we have intro-
# duced and discussed A and other conditions that ensure convergence. This
# expression and the condition that determines it are very important in the
# analysis of time series and other stochastic processes.

# 3.3.11 Inverses of Matrices with Special Forms
# Matrices with various special patterns may have relatively simple inverses.
# For example, the inverse of a diagonal matrix with nonzero entries is a diag-
# onal matrix consisting of the reciprocals of those elements. Likewise, a block
# diagonal matrix consisting of full-rank submatrices along the diagonal has an
# inverse that is merely the block diagonal matrix consisting of the inverses of
# the submatrices. We discuss inverses of various special matrices in Chapter 8.

# 3.3.12 Determining the Rank of a Matrix
# Although the equivalent canonical form (3.113) immediately gives the rank
# of a matrix, in practice the numerical determination of the rank of a matrix
# is not an easy task. The problem is that rank is a mapping IR n×m → ZZ + ,
# where ZZ + represents the positive integers. Such a function is often diﬃcult
# to compute because the domain is relatively dense and the range is sparse.

# It is not even always clear whether a matrix is nonsingular. Because of
# rounding on the computer, a matrix that is mathematically nonsingular may
# appear to be singular. We sometimes use the phrase “nearly singular” or
# “algorithmically singular” to describe such a matrix. In Sections 6.1 and 11.4,
# we consider this kind of problem in more detail.
