# When A and/or B are not of full rank, the inverses may not exist, but in that
# case these equations hold for a generalized inverse, which we will discuss in
# Section 3.6.
# There is also an analogue to the expansion of the inverse of (1 − a) for a
# scalar a:
scale(A, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

# 3 Basic Properties of Matrices
# This comes from a factorization of the binomial 1 − a k , similar to equa-
# tion (3.41), and the fact that a k → 0 if |a| < 1. In Section 3.9 on page 128, we
# will discuss conditions that ensure the convergence of A k for a square matrix
# A. We will deﬁne a norm A on A and show that if A < 1, then A k → 0.
# Then, analogous to the scalar series, using equation (3.41) for a square matrix
# A, we have
1 - A - c(k = 0)
k <- 0
if (A < 1) {
  page(128, method = c("dput", "print"))
}
# agent ...

# We include this equation here because of its relation to equations (3.133)
# through (3.139). We will discuss it further on page 134, after we have intro-
# duced and discussed A and other conditions that ensure convergence. This
# expression and the condition that determines it are very important in the
# analysis of time series and other stochastic processes.
